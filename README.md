# NMDS-Pollinator-Predictor
For this project we will utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict plant pollinators based on plant scent as well as flower color. This data was collected utilizing Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS) techniques to create a profile of over 40 different chemicals across the plant fragrance as well as the quantity of chemicals found in the plant fragrance.
