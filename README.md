# NMDS-Pollinator-Predictor
For this project we will utilize a machine learning algorithm to predict plant pollinators based on plant scent as well as flower color. This data was collected utilizing Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS) techniques to create a profile of over 40 different chemicals across the plant fragrance as well as the quantity of chemicals found in the plant fragrance.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
We began by importing our data from its online repository in github
### PMR Analysis
This analysis is to determine the different values that the various chemicals have on our pollinator.
### NMDS Analysis
Non-metric Multi Dimensional Scaling or NMDS is a form of machine learning that places variables int a data matrix to make graphical determinations about likeness for multi-vector variables. This is perfect to utilize for our plant fragrances, the closer two points are to one another on the graph, the closer their fragrance profile is to one another
### Certainty Intervals
In this section we will determine if our Machine has determined with any amount of certainty, the correct pollinators in our unknown variables
### Summary
Thank you for your time and I hope you found this presentation informative
